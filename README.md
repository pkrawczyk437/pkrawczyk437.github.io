# todoApp
Todo app created with pure javascript.
Here I tried to test some es6 features like new array methods, 
which in my opinion are much better than earlier ways of doing some operations on this type of data structure.

User can:
- Add new task to the list,
- Add task as finished(when checkbox is checked text will be crossed out)
- Remove current task from list

All added tasks are stored in LocalStorage
